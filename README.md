## Custom Starter Theme

### Instructions:

Change all instances of "starter" in functions.php to desired theme name.

Similarly, edit style.css (including URI and description!) and package.json. There is also a "starter" tag in footer.php.

You may also wish to edit this readme file to be about your new theme rather than the starter.

Be sure to install the jQuery updater plugin so that jQuery works.

Also remember: grunt build to build the assets folder.

Once everything is working, create a git repository of the same name. Then, locally:  
(You may first have to sudo rm -r .git to start fresh if you have just copied the whole package over)


git init  
git add --all  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git remote add origin git@github.com:Potato83/*themename*.git  
git push -u origin master
